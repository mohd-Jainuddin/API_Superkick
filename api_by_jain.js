        "description": "The 57/40 is the answer to a question that is simple, yet astronomical in scale. What if we updated the most New Balance shoe of all time – the 574? Despite its legacy of unassuming, almost effortless versatility, the original 574 was a unique design for its era, a hybrid road/trail design that didn’t lean on visible technical features. The 57/40 approaches the hybrid concept with a few extra years’ worth of design developments to explore, and creates a new perspective on an iconic design. An overall sleeker silhouette provided by a slimmer last combines with a range of exaggerated features. The unique midsole combines a flared take on the classic 574 construction with ‘90s tech inspired details, while the mudguard and eyerow feature the distinctive wavy embellishments of the ‘80s. The Lunar New Year Collection’s take on the 57/40 focuses on bold contrast, as a neutral upper is offset with black overlays and colorful ‘N’ branding, while a tiger camouflage tongue label serves as a subtle nod to the Year of the Tiger.",
